All api services:
- Like basically the functions with "withhttpinfo" in them
- The basepath assignment needs some modifications depending on function, the content type stuff, some body form response stuff
- comments of stuff needed to be done is in the template file

models.ts:
- does not account for enums

Done, should check:
configuration.ts
variables.ts
index.ts
encoder.ts added (template), have to implement function in typescript_client tho
api.module.ts added (template), have to implement function in typescript_client tho

Check uppercase and lowercase of first letter in my functions and other templates
